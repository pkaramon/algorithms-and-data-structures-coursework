# Algorithms and Data Structures Coursework 🚀

This repository contains my coursework for the Algorithms and Data Structures course at AGH University of Science and Technology (AGH UST).
The Course covered sorting algorithms, graph algorithms, and dynamic programming algorithms. All implementations are in Python.

## Introduction 🌟

This repository serves as a collection of the algorithms I've learned and implemented during my Algorithms
and Data Structures course at AGH UST. There are also my notes which I took during the course as well as exams/tests and
their solutions.
The repository is not very well-structured as it was created for my personal use and I treated it as a notebook.
